# Ruby Design Patterns

###Template Method
Identifies the framework of an algorithm, allowing implementing classes to define the actual behavior.

###Strategy
Identifies a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behavior.

Note: With the Template Method pattern, we make our decision when we pick our concrete subclass. In the Strategy pattern, we make our decision by selecting a strategy class at runtime.
